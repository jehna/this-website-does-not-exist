# This website does not exist
> A website that's generated by LLM for each request on the fly

In 2021 there was a famous site
[this-person-does-not-exist.com](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com), which
showcased how generative artificial intelligence could be used to create
lifelike images of people that weren't real. This spun out [many
clones](https://thisxdoesnotexist.com), from cats and cars to resumes and even
questions.

This website aims to be a tribute to the original, with a twist that now we have
entered an era where LLM output can be generated in
[obnoxious](https://www.cerebras.ai/inference)
[speeds](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-diffusion/) (1000+Â tokes/sec).
This allows for e.g. generating entire websites while the website is loading.

## Getting started

To see this website live, go to:

https://thiswebsitedoesnotexist.net

The website is hosted on a free Render.com account, so if the dyno is sleeping
it might take a few seconds to load.

### Running locally

You can also run this website locally and hack it as you like. Grab a token from
cerebras.ai and add it to `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` environment variable (or to `.env`
file). Then run:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

This installs all necessary dependencies and starts serving the website at
http://localhost:3000/


### Deploying

This website is deployed automagically on push to `main` via render.com CI.

## Features

This project is a website that:
* Generates the whole website from scratch every request
* Has a simple throttling and rotating for occasional spikes to avoid exhausting
  cerebras.ai quota
* Just a proof of content created to inspire others to build something based on
  it
* Inspired heavily by https://www.val.town/x/stevekrouse/cerebras_coder
